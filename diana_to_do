1. admin panel and auth for update, delete, add import
admin panel should require (via a popup) the admin credentials -> then buttons:
	add accident
	delete accident
	update accident
	import database
	export database

2. import feature

4. solution for too long waiting times for the API to respond (use limit or lookup sequelizer streams);
5. style admin panel
